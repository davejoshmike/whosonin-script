# whosonin-script
A quick bash script used to check each computer in the lab to see whether it is turned on, whether it is in Linux or Windows, or (if it is in Linux) who is actually logged on to the machine.

#After adding the words.txt file with all the names of the lab computers
#run:
sh whosonin.sh
